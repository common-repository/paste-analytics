== Frequently Asked Questions ==

No. Paste the script and save. Done!

= Can I do advanced tracking stuff with this plugin? =

Probably. You have the freedom to write whatever you need in the script.

= Can block IP numbers from being tracked? =

Yes and no. Not by this plugin, but you can do it with Google Analytics own settings.

= Does the tracking work when I'm logged in? =

No. It's disabled when logged in. Just a HTML comment remains in the code.

= Can I disable tracking on certain pages/post? =

Maybe. You can not do it with this plugin but it might be possible in Google Analytics, or by disable an action on that page.

= Why not just use an advanced Google Analytics plugin =

 * Advanced plugins often have tons of options. Still they might not have everything. With this plugin you can write the script as you like.
 * This plugin is very simple. Set it and forget it. Paste the script and save. Done!
 * This plugin only use one option field which makes it very fast.

= Why not use a before / after-plugin?

They are ment for all kinds of scripts / CSS / HTML. It also means more settings that you don't need.

= The tracking code does not appear? =

If you are not logged in and still no tracking code are visible in the source you might be missing the `wp_head` action in header.php (or another file)

= Can I have the tracking code in the footer or direcly after the <body>-tag?

No. Not at present. If `wp_head` is not in the theme it will try to use `wp_footer` instead.
